The open API manifesto. Crowdsourced.

<h2>Foreword</h2>
An API is an interface providing access to a resource, a data or a service. During the last few years, private APIs became public as a way for companies or other providers to outsource innovation.
This opening movement took on various forms, protocols, and led to various misunderstandings and conflicts about the notion of openness.

Open APIs must become the standard for automated, light and smart interactions in machines to machines interactions. This requires a paradigm in which API providers and third party developers can understand and trust one another.

This manifesto aims at providing the API industry with principles defining what should and should not be considered an open API. An API not complying with these principles should not be considered or labeled an Open API.


<h3>Lexical statement</h3>

This document refers to three overlapping concepts; by definition:
<ul>
<li>a public API is an API that can be seen and accessed directly through a portal with a SLA, without any prior contact with the API provider</li>
<li>a private API is an API accessed through a contract establishing a unique partnership between a provider and a consumer.</li>
<li>an open API is a public API that defines a valuable contract between an API provider and third-party developers. It hence has value for both parties.</li>
</ul>

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.



<h2>Principles</h2>

<h3>1- Publicity</h3>
Content and resources MUST be public. Public means that the description of the content and the resources fully understandable whithout identification requirement.
API SHOULD be explorable through a fiddle directly on the provider’s platform.
If not, descriptions MUST be visible through the provider’s platform (developer portal, API explorator).

<h3>2- NEUTRALITY</h3>
API access or content SHALL NOT present any discrimination among users.
API access can be dependent on the number of calls, the pricing plan subscribed, but CAN NOT depend on who the user is.

<h3>3- Content</h3>
Content MUST have value for third party users.

<h3>4- Access</h3>
Content MUST be machine readable. Usability will be enhanced by complying to standards allowing maximum interoperability.
These standards SHOULD be compliant with W3C or IANA standards.
If not, they SHOULD be compliant with internal standards withing the company.
If not, they MUST comply with personal standards, easily accessed through resources made available and accesiible.

<h3>5- Responsibility</h3>
Providers are accountable. ToS MUST state use conditions. Changes MUST be notified and explained to users. Their access MUST stay as it is if not stated otherwise before. + RELIABILITY (= technical responsibility): MUST involve all the resources needed to maintain it.
previously explained judicial process for a provider to revoke an access

<h3>6- Writing/ Derivation/ Re-use/ Open source/ Open Assets</h3>
is read only open?
open source interface, data models: open API if you open your server
